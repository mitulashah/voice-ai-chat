# Feature Design Document: Database Optimization - SQLite + Blob Storage Sync

## Feature Overview
**What is this feature?**  
A hybrid database solution that uses SQLite for fast local operations while persisting data to Azure Blob Storage for durability across container restarts. This solves the current issue where SQLite doesn't work reliably with Azure Files network mounts in Container Apps.

**Who is it for?**  
Development team addressing database persistence issues in Azure Container Apps deployment.

---

## Goals & Success Criteria

- **Resolve data loss**: Eliminate the current issue where seeded database data disappears after container operations
- **Maintain performance**: Keep SQLite's fast query performance for runtime operations
- **Ensure persistence**: Database survives container restarts, scaling events, and deployments
- **Simplify infrastructure**: Remove dependency on Azure Files mounts
- **Success criteria**: 
  - Database data persists across container restarts (100% reliability)
  - API response times remain under 200ms
  - Zero data corruption during backup/restore cycles

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **Startup restore**: Container loads latest database snapshot from blob storage on startup
- **Periodic backup**: Database periodically syncs to blob storage (every 5-10 minutes)
- **Graceful shutdown**: Database saves final snapshot to blob storage before container shutdown
- **Conflict resolution**: Handle multiple container instances gracefully (single writer model)
- **Fallback behavior**: Create fresh database if no backup exists in blob storage
- **Local development**: Gracefully handle environments without blob storage (npm run dev, docker-compose)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Backup operations must not block database reads/writes
- **Reliability**: Handle network failures during backup/restore operations
- **Security**: Use managed identity for blob storage access
- **Monitoring**: Add telemetry for backup success/failure rates
- **Resource efficiency**: Minimize storage costs and network bandwidth

---

## Feature Design

### Backend / Data
- **New Azure Blob Storage container**: `database-backups` for storing SQLite snapshots
- **Enhanced DocumentDatabase class**: Add blob sync capabilities
- **Backup scheduler**: Background process for periodic saves
- **Startup sequence**: Download → restore → initialize → start API server
- **Shutdown hooks**: Ensure final backup before container termination

### Infrastructure Changes
- **Remove Azure Files**: Eliminate current problematic network mount
- **Add Blob Storage**: Create dedicated container for database backups
- **Update Container Apps**: Remove volume mounts, add blob storage connection
- **Managed Identity**: Grant blob storage read/write permissions

---

## Implementation Plan

### 1. **Setup & Infrastructure**
   - Add `@azure/storage-blob` package to server dependencies
   - Create blob storage container in Terraform (`database-backups`)
   - Update Container Apps configuration to remove Azure Files mount
   - Configure managed identity with blob storage permissions
   - Add environment variables for blob storage connection

### 2. **Core Database Sync Logic**
   - Extend `DocumentDatabase` class with blob sync methods:
     - `saveToBlob()`: Upload current database to blob storage
     - `restoreFromBlob()`: Download and restore database from blob storage
     - `initializeWithRestore()`: New startup sequence with restore logic
   - Implement **environment detection**: Check if blob storage is available/configured
   - **Local development mode**: Fall back to file-based SQLite when blob storage unavailable
   - **Production mode**: Use blob storage for persistence
   - Implement backup scheduler using `setInterval()` or cron-like pattern
   - Add graceful shutdown handler to save final snapshot
   - Handle edge cases: blob not found, network failures, corruption detection

### 3. **Integration & Production Readiness**
   - Update server startup sequence to restore from blob before accepting requests
   - Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic for blob operations
   - Implement telemetry/logging for backup operations (success rate, timing, size)
   - Add health checks to verify database and blob sync status
   - Test container restart scenarios and scaling events
   - Remove debugging code from previous troubleshooting

---

## Testing & Validation

### Unit Tests
- Blob storage upload/download operations
- Database backup/restore functionality
- Error handling for network failures
- Edge cases (empty blob, corrupted data)

### Integration Tests
- Full container restart cycle with data persistence
- Multiple container instances (ensure single writer)
- Network interruption during backup operations
- Database initialization from empty vs existing blob

### Manual Testing
- Deploy to Azure and verify data persists across container restarts
- Test scaling scenarios (scale down to 0, scale back up)
- Verify performance impact of backup operations
- Test blob storage access with managed identity

### Acceptance Criteria
- Database data survives container restarts (tested 10+ times)
- API performance remains under 200ms response time
- Backup operations complete within 30 seconds
- No data corruption during backup/restore cycles
- Zero authentication errors with managed identity

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backup Strategy
```typescript
// Enhanced pseudo-code for backup flow with environment detection
class DocumentDatabase {
  private blobClient?: BlobServiceClient;
  private useBlobStorage: boolean = false;
  
  constructor(dbPath?: string) {
    // Detect environment and blob storage availability
    this.useBlobStorage = !!(process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME && 
                            process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production');
    
    if (this.useBlobStorage) {
      this.initializeBlobClient();
    }
  }
  
  private async saveToBlob(): Promise<void> {
    if (!this.useBlobStorage) {
      // In local development, save to file system instead
      return this.saveToFile();
    }
    
    const dbBuffer = this.db.export();
    const blobName = `voice-ai-documents-latest.db`;
    await this.blobClient.uploadData(dbBuffer, { overwrite: true });
  }
  
  private async restoreFromBlob(): Promise<boolean> {
    if (!this.useBlobStorage) {
      // In local development, try to load from file system
      return this.loadFromFile();
    }
    
    try {
      const blobBuffer = await this.blobClient.downloadToBuffer();
      this.db = new SQL.Database(blobBuffer);
      return true;
    } catch (error) {
      console.log('No backup found, starting fresh');
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment-Specific Behavior
- **Local Development (`npm run dev`)**: 
  - Uses file-based SQLite (current behavior)
  - Database persists in `./data/voice-ai-documents.db`
  - No blob storage operations
  
- **Docker Compose**: 
  - Uses file-based SQLite with volume mount
  - Database persists across container restarts via volume
  - No blob storage operations
  
- **Azure Container Apps (Production)**:
  - Uses ephemeral SQLite + blob storage sync
  - Restores from blob on startup, saves periodically
  - No file system persistence needed

### Deployment Sequence
1. **Update infrastructure**: Deploy Terraform changes (blob storage, remove files mount)
2. **Update application code**: Deploy new server image with blob sync logic
3. **Verify persistence**: Test container restart scenarios
4. **Monitor performance**: Check backup timing and success rates

- **Local development**: Zero configuration changes needed for developers
- **Future optimization**: Consider incremental backups for large databases
- **Monitoring**: Add Azure Monitor alerts for backup failure rates
- **Cost optimization**: Implement blob lifecycle policies for old snapshots

### Runtime Control of skipRestore
- You can override blob restore on startup by setting the `SKIP_RESTORE` environment variable to `true`.

  In Windows PowerShell:
  ```powershell
  $Env:SKIP_RESTORE = 'true'
  npm run start
  ```

  In Docker Compose or Azure Container Apps, add the `SKIP_RESTORE=true` environment variable under your service configuration.

### Environment Detection Logic
```typescript
// Environment detection strategy
const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
const hasAzureStorage = !!(process.env.AZURE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME);
const isAzureContainer = !!(process.env.CONTAINER_APP_NAME);

const useBlobStorage = isProduction && hasAzureStorage && isAzureContainer;
```
